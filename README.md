## Instructions
Once the user starts the app, a welcome screen will be displayed including a welcome message, two pictures of the latest meals, an input field and two navigation buttons. To view all the desserts, the user can click on the "List all Desserts" button to go to another page which contains a scroll view showing all desserts (including their pictures, name and id). The user can then click on any dessert (either picture, name or id) to see the details including its picture, name, cooking instructions, ingredients and measures.

The user can go back to the welcome screen by clicking the "Back" button on the top left corner of each view. To search for a dessert, the user can enter an id in the text field on the welcome screen and then click the "See Dessert Details" button which will lead to the detail view of the dessert including its picture, name, cooking instructions, ingredients and measures.
